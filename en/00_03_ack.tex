I would like to thank to all the people that made this project possible. First of all, I would like to deeply thank Ioannis Glaropoulos for his invaluable help and advice through all the project and the daily meetings discussing all the experiments and results, that allow me to learn a lot about the topic under study. My thanks also to Prof. Viktoria Fodor for her guidelines and suggestions for the experiments and for the detailed review of my thesis. Also my thanks to Marcello Lagan√† for his help with the software and the multiple suggestions to improve it. Most importantly, to my family for their support during the last year and for giving me the opportunity to study abroad.
