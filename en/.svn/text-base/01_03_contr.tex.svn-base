\section{Main Contribution} \label{sec:contribution}

In this report we first extend the model of the busy and idle transmission periods in the \ac{WLAN}, proposed in \cite{DSA-Emp}. We enhance the original model with a \textit{local view} component, by considering also the limited detection range of the sensors.

Since we focus on sensors that are hardware-constrained devices, we also propose computationally efficient ways to estimate the parameters of the model and its extension. For both models we use mathematical methods like the \acf{MLE} and the \acf{MV}, but in addition we employ a Neural Network based approach for the model extension for the local view.

Furthermore, the parameter estimation processes are accomplished locally and without any collaboration among sensors, since the communication for exchanging information increases the energy overhead and, hence, it drains the battery.

Our contribution includes a statistical evaluation of the algorithms proposed. We show that the estimation can achieve good approximation of the parameters for idle period distribution of the \ac{WLAN} traffic, even when sensor can only see partially this distribution.

The proposed algorithms will be included in the energy-efficient cross-layer communication framework, building a \textit{cognitive} communication protocol that is able to optimize packet transmission time and distance, accordingly to the parameters estimated by only measuring the wireless spectrum activity.
