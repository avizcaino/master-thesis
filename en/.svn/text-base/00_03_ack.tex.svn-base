I would like to express my gratitude to all those who made this work possible. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor in Italy, Prof. Chiara Petrioli, for giving me the great opportunity to study abroad and my supervisor in Sweden, Prof. Viktoria Fodor, for her invaluable advice and guidance during this whole master thesis project.
I owe my deepest gratitude to Ioannis Glaropoulos for taking me under his wing and especially not only for supporting me throughout this work with constructive suggestions that helped me sort out different details, but also for the time spent carefully reading and commenting the drafting of this thesis.
I also would like to thank all the members of the \acl{LCN} of \acs{KTH} for their kindness and their hospitality in this laboratory, where I found a friendly and comfortable working environment, making this period a pleasant experience.
Most importantly, none of this would have been possible without the encouragement of my family and their absolute confidence in me.
