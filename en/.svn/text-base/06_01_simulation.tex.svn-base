We provide a simulation infrastructure of coexisting \ac{WLAN} and \ac{WSN}, and evaluated the sensing performance in terms of a common understanding of the channel activity model. After acquiring a statistical meaningful dataset of estimation errors among the sensors, we evaluated the \ac{CV}, where the low resulting value showed that all the sensors estimate almost the same parameter set. Through simulations we also concluded that the probability distribution for inactive periods also holds for a more complex (and realistic) traffic model.

The purpose of this work is to supply tools for future Cognitive \ac{MAC} protocol for \ac{WSN} design, providing efficient algorithms for parameter estimation and bounds in the estimation error with respect the number of samples acquired. Future works will include simulations of a deployed \ac{WSN} with a full implemented Cognitive \ac{MAC} that uses our tools and we will evaluate the performance gains in terms of throughput and energy saving.
