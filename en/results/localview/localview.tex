\chapter{Local View: Results} \label{chapter:local_results}
As it has been explained in previous chapters (see Chapter \ref{sec:local_view_model}), the sensors have a limited sensing capability due to hardware limitations. In the Global View case, we studied an ideal case in which the sensors can observe the activity of the whole network. On the other hand, the Local View case, the sensing limitation is translated into a limited observation of the spectrum activity of the network: the sensors will only be able to observe the traffic generated by the \acs{WLAN} users inside the sensor's sensing range.

In order to solve this, a three-state Semi-Markovian model has been proposed in \cite{marcello} (represented in Figure \ref{fig:semi-markov_local}) in which the observable and non-observable active periods are taken into account for the model using the $Pcca$ probability, which determines the amount of non-observable traffic. The assumption in this model is the fact that the consecutive active \acs{WLAN} periods are independent, i.e. are originated from independent \acs{WLAN} users or "sessions". This will be the starting point for the experiments for the Local View model.

Chapter \ref{chapter:global_results} introduced the results of the different experiments developed for the Global View model, including a full set of experiments for the next points:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Testing of the fitting of the semi-Markovian model for the Extended Multi-Layer traffic model proposed in \cite{Campus-WLAN} and \cite{marcello}.
	\item Testing of the estimation process for the parameters: testing the MLE process and the construction of the estimated distribution using the parameters.
	\item Validation test of the fitting of the estimated distribution against the empirical using a Goodness-of-fit test: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
	\item Study of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
\end{itemize}

This chapter will present a set of experiments and its results for the Local View Model. Following the same procedure developed for the Global View model, we will test the fitting of the 3-state semi-Markovian model for the Local View model, the estimation process and the validation test for the fitting between empirical and estimated distributions.
