\chapter{Local View Model} \label{chapter:local_view_model}
The Local View model is the 'real' model, in which the \acs{WSN} sensors have a limited sensing capability due to hardware limitations. In this model, the sensors are only able to observe a portion of the whole network's traffic. The semi-Markov model proposed for this model is represented in Figure \ref{fig:semi_markov_local}.
