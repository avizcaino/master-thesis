\section{Local View: The Model} \label{sec:local_view_model}
While the Global View model presented in Section \ref{sec:global_view_model} reflects an ideal case in which the sensors have an unlimited sensing capability and are able to observe the whole spectrum activity of the network, in real terms, we need to face a series of issues that can be present in the model. The sensors, due to hardware limitations, have a limited sensing capability, being only able to observe a portion of the network's traffic. So a new model for the observable load of the \acs{WSN} sensor is needed.

This section will present briefly the Local View model characteristics (scenario and modelling) and estimation process.
