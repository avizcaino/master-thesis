\section{Global View Model} \label{sec:global_view_model}
The Global View model reflects an "ideal" case in which the sensors in the \acs{WSN} have an unlimited sensing capability. The sensors are able to observe the whole \acs{WLAN} spectrum activity and, because of that, this observable load can be modelled using the simplified semi-Markovian model presented in Figure \ref{fig:semi-markov}.

From the observed traffic, the sensors must estimate the parameters for the Active ($\alpha_{on}$ and $\beta$) and Idle ($\xi$, $\sigma$  and ${p}$) distributions defined in (\ref{eq:Active}) and (\ref{eq:Idle}) in order to reconstruct the spectrum activity for the prediction process.

This section will present briefly the main characteristics of the Global View model.
